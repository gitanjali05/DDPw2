This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

```

Marker with a picture of the Eiffel tower and a

```{r}
eiffelTowerIcon <- makeIcon(
   iconUrl = "https://www.city2map.com/images/where/eiffeltower.jpg",
   iconWidth = 31*408/255, iconHeight = 31,
   iconAnchorX = 31*408/255/2, iconAnchorY = 16
)
```

Add the marker to the map and display the map.
```{r}
eiffelTowerPopup <- c("<a href= 'https://www.toureiffel.paris/en/the-monument/key-figures' >Eiffel Tower<br><img src='https://www.city2map.com/images/where/eiffeltower.jpg' width='240' height='181'  alt='Eiffel Tower in Paris' title='Eiffel Tower'></a>")

my_map %>%
   addTiles() %>%
   addMarkers(lat=48.8584, lng=2.2945, popup = eiffelTowerPopup)
```
